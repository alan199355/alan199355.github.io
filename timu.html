	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the first question parents ask when their child is diagnosed with autism (自闭症). Will his future brothers or sisters have a higher risk of 1 <span class="answer_wrapper" id="answer_wrapper_1"><span id="answer_1" class="answer"></span></span> it, too? According to the largest study of siblings (兄弟姐妹) in families with autism, the answer is yes. Among 664 children who had at least one older sibling with the developmental disorder, the 2 <span class="answer_wrapper" id="answer_wrapper_2"><span id="answer_2" class="answer"></span></span> risk of autism was nearly 19%, 3 <span class="answer_wrapper" id="answer_wrapper_3"><span id="answer_3" class="answer"></span></span> higher than previous sibling-recurrence estimates that were anywhere from 3% to 10%. Kids with more than one older autistic sibling had an even higher risk of the disorder: 32%.</p>

Evidence suggests that early 9 <span class="answer_wrapper" id="answer_wrapper_9"><span id="answer_9" class="answer"></span></span> and diagnosis of autism can help children take advantage of therapies that can 	treat some of its 10 <span class="answer_wrapper" id="answer_wrapper_10"><span id="answer_10" class="answer"></span></span> </p>
